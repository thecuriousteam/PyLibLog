          <h2>What is Flask?</h2>
          <p>
            Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It's designed to be
            lightweight and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building
            web applications and APIs. With Flask, you can quickly get a web
            server up and running and then expand it with various extensions
            based on your needs. It doesn't come with everything and the kitchen
            sink, but that's the beauty of it—you add what you need, keeping
            things simple and efficient. So, are you diving into Flask for a
            specific project?

          <h2>Some key points related to Flask:</h2>
          <p>
            Flask is like the minimalist chef's knife of web frameworks in the
            Python world. It provides the essentials you need to get a web
            application going without overwhelming you with unnecessary
            features.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <h3><li>Micro framework:</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask is often referred to as a "micro" framework because it
              focuses on keeping the core simple and leaving many decisions to
              the developer. This simplicity gives you more flexibility in
              choosing the components you want for your project.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Routing</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask uses a decorator-based syntax for defining routes. This
              makes it easy to map URLs to functions. For example, if you want a
              function to handle requests to the root URL, you can use
              @app.route('/') above the function.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Templates</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask comes with a simple template engine called Jinja2. It allows
              you to embed dynamic content in your HTML pages. This separation
              of logic and presentation is a common practice in web development.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Web Server</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask has a built-in development server, making it easy to test
              your applications locally. For production, you might use a more
              robust server like Gunicorn or deploy it behind a web server like
              Nginx or Apache.
            </p>
            <h3><li>RESTful Support</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask is often used to build RESTful APIs. Its simplicity and
              flexibility make it a great choice for quickly creating APIs that
              can serve and consume data.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Werkzeug and Jinja2</li></h3>
            <p>
              Flask builds on two other libraries: Werkzeug, a WSGI utility
              library, and Jinja2, a template engine. These provide the
              underlying functionality for request handling and template
              rendering, respectively.
            </p>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember, the beauty of Flask is in its simplicity and the freedom
            it gives you to shape your application the way you want.

          <h2>Differences Between Django vs Flask:</h2>
          <p>
            Django and Flask stand out as leading Python web frameworks, with
            Flask emerging as a viable alternative to Django. Designers sought
            increased flexibility, desiring the autonomy to shape their
            implementation choices. In contrast, Django, known for its robust
            conventions, does not readily accommodate extensive alterations to
            its modules. Flask, prized for its simplicity and unobtrusiveness,
            enables seasoned Python developers to swiftly embark on projects,
            delivering results within remarkably tight timelines.
          </p>

            <h3><li>Philosophy and Complexity:</li></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h5>Flask:</h5>
                Often referred to as a micro-framework, Flask embraces
                simplicity and minimalism. It provides the essential tools to
                get a web application up and running but leaves many decisions,
                such as the choice of database or ORM, to the developer. Flask
                is lightweight and gives developers the flexibility to choose
                the components they want to use, making it a great choice for
                small to medium-sized projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Django:</h5>
                Adheres to the "batteries-included" philosophy. It comes with a
                plethora of built-in features, including an ORM, an admin
                interface, and a predefined project structure. While this can be
                powerful for rapid development, it might feel more opinionated
                and heavyweight compared to Flask. Django's conventions can be
                advantageous for larger projects where a standardized approach
                is beneficial.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><li>Admin Interface</li></h3>
            <p>
              The useful admin interface is what makes Django a capable web
              system. Not at all like Flask, Django incorporates a ready-to-use
              admin system that empowers clients to carry out extended
              organization errands consistently. Based on the venture, it
              naturally creates admin modules. Engineers can indeed customize
              the admin interface in arrange to meet particular trade needs.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Database</li></h3>
            <p>
              Django has to bolster the ORM framework. Advantage of the ORM
              framework includes: Developers can take advantage of the ORM
              framework to work with an assortment of databases, including
              PostgreSQL, SQLite, Prophet, MySQL, and more. Developers don’t
              have to type in long SQL inquiries to execute common database
              operations. Whereas, Flask doesn’t support the ORM framework.
              Designers are required to type in SQLAlchemy (Protest Social
              Mapper and SQL toolkit for Python) in arrange to perform common
              database operations.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Built-in template engine</li></h3>
            <p>
              Not at all like Django, Flask doesn’t have a built-in layout
              motor. Flask is based on the Jinja2 format motor. Jinja2 is itself
              impacted by the Django format motor. Its employments coordinate a
              sandboxed execution environment, permitting engineers to speed up
              the advancement handle for energetic web applications. While
              Django incorporates a built-in format motor that permits engineers
              to make user-facing layers for web applications consistently nd
              quickly.

          <h2>How to Install Flask in Windows?</h2>
          <p>
            Flask is basically a Python module. It can work with Python only and
            it is a web-developing framework. It is a collection of libraries
            and modules. Frameworks are used for developing web platforms. Flask
            is such a type of web application framework. It is completely
            written in Python language. Unlike Django, it is only written in
            Python. As a new user, Flask is to be used. As it is easier to
            handle. As it is only written in Python, before installing Flask on
            the machine, Python should be installed previously.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <h3><li>Install Flask:</li></h3>
            <p>
              Once you have Python and the Command Prompt open, you can use the
              following command to install Flask using <em>'pip'</em>, which is
              the package installer for Python:
            </p>

            <b><em>> pip install Flask</em></b>
            <h3><li>Verify Installation:</li></h3>
            <p>
              To check if Flask was installed successfully, you can run the
              following command:
            </p>
            <b><em>flask --version </em></b>
            <h3><li>Create a Flask App:</li></h3>
            <p>
              Create a new directory for your Flask project and navigate to it
              in the Command Prompt. <br />
              Inside your project directory, create a new Python file (e.g.,
              app.py) and use a text editor to write your Flask application
              code.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Run Your Flask App:</li></h3>
            <p>
