      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-700">Introduction to Pandas</h1>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        Welcome to the world of Pandas, where you'll learn to wield the power of data with ease. Pandas is more than just a cute bear; it's also a versatile Python library that empowers you to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effortlessly. Let's dive deeper into Pandas basics.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6">What is Pandas?</h2>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides you with easy-to-use data structures and functions that enable you to work with structured data effectively. If you've ever worked with data in spreadsheets or databases, Pandas will feel like a familiar friend.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        At its core, Pandas introduces two main data structures: the <strong>Series</strong> and the <strong>DataFrame</strong>. A Series is like a one-dimensional array with labels, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional table like a spreadsheet or SQL table. These structures open up endless possibilities for data manipulation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6">Key Features of Pandas:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        <li>
          <b>Data Structures:</b> Pandas provides the Series and DataFrame data structures to store and work with data. These structures are highly flexible and can handle various data types.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Data is rarely perfect. Pandas offers powerful tools to clean and preprocess data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Selection:</b> You can easily select and filter data, allowing you to focus on the information relevant to your analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Aggregation:</b> Pandas enables you to summarize data, create pivot tables, and aggregate information based on specific criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Visualization:</b> While not a dedicated visualization library, Pandas can work seamlessly with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots and charts.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6">Why Use Pandas?</h2>

      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        You might be wondering, "Why should I bother with Pandas when I can work with data in other ways?" The answer lies in Pandas' efficiency and user-friendliness.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        Without Pandas, you'd find yourself writing numerous lines of code to perform even the simplest data operations. Pandas simplifies data manipulation tasks, streamlining the process and making it more intuitive.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-2">
        Here are a few scenarios where Pandas shines:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-600 text-lg">
        <li>
          <b>Data Exploration:</b> Quickly get an overview of your dataset by inspecting its structure and contents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Address issues like missing values, outliers, and duplicate records without the headache of manual data wrangling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Transformation:</b> Shape your data to suit your analysis needs, whether it's reshaping, pivoting, or aggregating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Analysis:</b> Dive into in-depth analysis by selecting, filtering, and aggregating data, and create visualizations for better insights.
        </li>
